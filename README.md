# Objective
A chief goal of this project is to contribute towards the academic understanding of stock market prediction.
For this, we have created a model that analyzes previous stock data of certain companies, with the help of certain parameters that affect stock value.Thus, we will determine the values that a particular stock will have in the near future and show that Data Analysis and Machine Learning could be used to guide an investor's decisions.
# Project Functions
The following sequence of operations will be opted to reach the desired predictions:
1. DATA COLLECTION: The historical data of various companies since 03/01/05 is collected from various sites such as Google Finance, Yahoo Finance, Investing.com, etc. This data consists of attributes like open, close, high, low, and volume.
3. DECIDING FACTORS: The stock market prices depend on various factors like Sensex, Nifty, Hang Seng, USD/INR, etc. Data regarding these factors is also collected as it is essential for proceeding to the predictive analysis.
4. DATA DIVISION: The data of any particular company is divided into two parts, i.e., training data and testing data. The training data is fed to a model which consists of an algorithm for data prediction using linear regression.
